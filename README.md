Last six years, As an open-source evangelist, I am focused on industrial IoT, automation and secure data exchange in Industry 4.0
I was working closely with Enterprises in designing mission-critical, real-life IoT solutions.

These days I am working on new ideas with the primary mission of building community first open IoT governance with shared ownership. A mission is to design and develop tools and technology for the enterprise, robust IoT solutions.
